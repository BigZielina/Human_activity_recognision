The dataset is compressed in the zip files. 
Original dataset consist of 2 files:
  test.csv
  train.csv

Original dataset was reduced in the file preprocsses.ipynb, where I created:
  test_droped.csv
  train_droped.csv
  
Both files are compressed in reduced_dataset.zip. 
The models.ipynb only refers to reduced dataset.

You can find full description of the project in MLAI_report.pdf
